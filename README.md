# NEXCOM™ 

NEX = A connection or series of connections linking two or more things.

COM = Communication

NEXCOM™ is a centralized communications system that forwards messages and calls (Voice & Video) from all communications platforms and accounts such as Facebook Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Discord, Teams, Telegram, etc., using an API. The messages and calls are forwarded to the native application on the users mobile device such as FaceTime, Messages, Phone and Mail. The messages can be identified from the originating platform or kept hidden, consequently, the user simply sees a message that appears no different from a text message, email or call and can reply or answer without the need to use each platforms individual application. This eliminates the need for users to install multiple massaging platforms on a device, thereby reducing the attack surface and improving the device security posture. Additionally, end-to-end encryption is maintained thereby giving the user privacy and data integrity. Below is rudimentary flow diagram:
